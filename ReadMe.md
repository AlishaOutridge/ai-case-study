Comparatively, AudioShake's unique offerings and tech-first approach positions it strongly against competitors, especially since it defined its own niche with a deep 1st mover moat focused on the unmixing of tracks without access to original recordings.

## Recommendations

*Two Questions Answered below:*
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

To further cement its position, I would advise AudioShake to integrate with a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) so that their product can be leveraged during the create music phase by artists within the workstation tools directly. This would lower their Cost Per User Acquisition Costs and take them more directly into the music creation flow instead of within the Music AI niche.

Two Key Partners I would connect Jessica Powell with if she doesn't know them already are:
 1) Ableton Live
Context: As a leading digital audio workstation (DAW) favored by electronic music producers and live performers, Ableton Live could greatly benefit from direct access to AudioShake's unmixing capabilities. This would allow producers to seamlessly integrate isolated vocals or instruments into their projects, fostering innovation in music production.
2)  Logic Pro
Context: Similar to Ableton, Logic Pro is a comprehensive DAW with a strong user base among professional music producers. Integration with AudioShake could streamline the workflow for users looking to incorporate samples or remix elements into their music, directly enhancing the creative process.

This would result in AudioShake becoming more centrally in the music production ecosystem, potentially leading to increased user adoption and retention. It situates the tool within the natural workflow of its target audience, making it an indispensable part of the music creation process.

Finally, being part of a DAW could encourage users to explore new creative possibilities with AudioShake's technology, from remixing to sample creation that we don't know about yet in this rapidly evolving landscape of Music AI, further embedding the tool in the creative process and driving user engagement.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

For AudioShake, my proposal above to integrate within Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) directly like Ableton Live and Logic Pro would leverage AudioShake's API (Application Programming Interface) allowing seamless communication between AudioShake's AI-driven unmixing tools and the DAW environments while artists + music producers are creating, sampling & remixing music. More users would also help this new emerging tech continue evolving to improve the accuracy and quality of the audio separation.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

Using AudioShake's API technology to integrate directly into DAWs in both their software & cloud-based apps direectly where artists + producers are creating music directly supports the creation of a more integrated and efficient workflow for music producers, who rely on DAWs as their primary creative environment. 

By embedding AudioShake directly into these popular mainstream platforms, the tool becomes a natural extension of the music production process, increasing its usability and adoption. Furthermore, APIs allow for scalable and flexible solutions that can adapt to various DAWs, catering to a wide range of users and use cases within the music production community.

Other than the strategic growth objectives I suggested above, this approach leverages AudioShake's existing technologies' strengths and addresses the needs of music producers, ensuring AudioShake remains a valuable and innovative tool in the music production landscape.
